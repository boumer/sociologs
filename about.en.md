## The blog

When I launched SocioLogs in December 2016, I thought a blog would be a good way to help me think through some of my favorite subjects âˆ’ since talking out loud seemed to fail.
That's why the posts will essentially focus on sociology, digital technologies and/or statistics.

Even though the blog doesn't have a comment section, your remarks or, better yet, your contributions are very valuable to me.
I encourage you to use [Github Issues](https://github.com/gaalcaras/sociologs/issues/) to signal a typo, correct a fact or propose an alternative reasoning.
If Github is not to your liking, you can contact me through [email](mailto:{{ site.email }}) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/{{ site.twitter_username }}).
